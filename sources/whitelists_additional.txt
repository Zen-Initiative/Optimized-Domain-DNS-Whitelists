## Blokada subdomain whitelist (subdomains only: www, api, cdn ...)
## https://github.com/blokadaorg/landing-github-pages/blob/master/scripts/whitelist-subdomains 

## Blokada whitelists
(1) "manual" = presumably Blokada's own whitelist
(2) "whitelist" = "manual" + 3rd-party lists (including several duplicate & deprecated lists)
See https://github.com/blokadaorg/landing-github-pages/blob/master/scripts/gen-whitelist.py
Both lists contain whole domains ("facebook.com", "google.com", etc). Depending on your blocking method, this can potentially 
whitelist/unblock all the subdomains of these websites, leading to possible false negatives (e.g. tracking subdomains unblocked).
