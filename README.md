# ðŸ‘»Optimized Domain/DNS Whitelists

Whitelists to remove false positives from DNS blocklists, hosts files, Pi-Hole blocklists, and other types of filter lists.
- Curated: carefully selected from many well-known community sources.
- Optimized: deprecated lists excluded, and duplicates removed.
- Customizable: multiple versions provided, or use the scripts and [source lists](https://github.com/Zen-Initiative/Optimized-Domain-DNS-Whitelists/tree/main/sources) to customize and generate your own whitelist.
